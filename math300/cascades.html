<h3>Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tables can be difficult to format.
They should be avoided when possible.</li>
<li>Div tags should be used liberally in
markup.</li> 
<li>When specifying font families,
allow many choices for different
platforms.</li>
<li>There are kits of extra CSS specifications
not directly supported by browsers: -moz- for Mozilla
products, and -webkit- for Chrome/Safari/IE.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) constitute a 
collection of W3C
specifications that give tremendous control over the
appearance of a document, even as the style 
specifications can actually be separated from the 
content of the document.  In this way, a single
set of style specifications can be used to 
format many different pages - even entire web sites.

The word "cascading" refers to an algorithm that 
specifies uniquely what happens when multiple 
styles are applied to a single body of text.
The idea is that we can apply styles to a high-level 
HTML element, and then subsequently apply more styles
to lower levels of HTML elements
that augment or even override the styles applied at
the higher level.  Thus, there is a "cascade" of
style specifications that apply to any given 
HTML element.
</p>
<p id="trails">Cascading Style Sheets should not be confused 
with the Cascade Mountains of Washington state.
However, we can draw a few gratuitous parallels.
In particular, it is alarmingly easy to become
bogged down in ugly detail using CSS.  If we 
start randomly to apply styles to low-level elements,
we quickly end up with CSS that looks like 
a typical Cascade Mountain trail experience, as 
depicted in Figure 1.
</p>
<p id="views">By contrast, if we use good structural
markup for our HTML, and then design the formatting
from the top down, our formatting can be
as clean and clear as the view from the top
of a mountain, as illustrated in Figure 2.
To make this happen, we should always do 
our best to use some abstract design
ideas.
<ul>
<li>The document itself should be carefully 
structured.</li>
<li>Style specifications in the HTML file 
should be avoided - use classes and IDs 
to apply special styles.</li>
<li>Style specifications for a given structural
element should be designed from the highest-level
down.</li>
</ul>

Given the complexities of CSS formatting, one
can see why so many web developers insist on 
fixed-width formatting.  That allows them to
specify the size of every HTML element explicitly, 
and know that they will all fit together.  On
the other hand, using a fixed-width format
means that on large screens there will be vast
swaths of unused space, while on small screens
most of the content falls off the screen.
A great deal of modern CSS is devoted to making 
a layout that works for both a large desktop computer
and a small mobile phone.
